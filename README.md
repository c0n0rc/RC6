# RC6 Implementation

To run:
```bash
./run ./input.txt ./output.txt
```

### Notes:
- Runs with `./run ./input.txt ./output.txt` not `./run input.txt output.txt`. This was done to follow submission guidelines.
- Stores plaintext and userkey in vectors. Stores L and S (arrays from paper) in dynamic arrays.
